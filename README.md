# frontend-mentor-product-preview-card-component
Solution to the Frontend Mentor product preview card component using semantic HTML and SCSS.

Thank you for taking interest in my solution! This is my first time using SCSS, so a lot of time was spent experimenting with folder structure. I basically just wrote what I would have in CSS, but separated the typography, layout, and styling sections into different files, then further separated these into mobile and desktop folders for the different versions of the webpage.

The layout of the card was created using CSS flexbox.
